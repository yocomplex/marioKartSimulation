# marioKartSimulation

Description:
Mario Kart. The game that can ruin friendships, especially if you prime a red shell right behind your friend right before theyâ€™re about to win the race. In this simulation of Mario Kart, there are no opportunities to pick up any items, just an ordinary race. We will maintain the racers in the race using a priority queue using a binary min heap.

Credits:
Shoutout to my professor, Dr. James Andro Vasko, for creating this fun project. I enjoyed creating the main file that simulates the Mario Kart using a priority queue.

How to:
You run the main file using linux file redirection "./a.out < simulation1.txt" or "./a.out < simulation2.txt"
The output sample text files are "out1.txt" for "simulation1.txt" or "out2.txt" for "simulation2.txt"
