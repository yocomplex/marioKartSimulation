# marioKartSimulation
Mario Kart. The game that can ruin friendships, especially if you prime a red shell right behind your friend right before theyâ€™re about to win the race. In this simulation of Mario Kart, there are no opportunities to pick up any items, just an ordinary race. We will maintain the racers in the race using a priority queue using a binary min heap.
